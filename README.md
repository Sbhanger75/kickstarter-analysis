# Overview of Kickstarter Campaign
The purpose of the analysis done on Louise’s campaign was to see what theater plays were successful and what ones were not.  Over the course of several years, data has been collected on the monetary success of plays to gauge how much money was needed to produce these plays and how much was contributed by the plays’ backers.  The end result shows Louise’s endeavors did bear fruit as she had more success than failure.
But, this is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to our analysis of her project.
We looked at many aspects of Louise’s campaign to assist her with broad pictures of exactly how she was doing overall.  First, we looked at the outcomes of plays based on their launch date.  We saw the busiest and most successful time to be in May as shown in the following chart.
 
The least busy and successful and successful time was at the end of the year.  A couple factors for this could be the holiday season or the weather.  Second, we looked at the outcomes based on the monetary ask for each play—organized by bands of $5000.00.  The vast majority of plays (with the highest rate of success) cost between zero and $5000.00 to produce.  Small productions seem to be the most popular and successful.
Two conclusions we can draw from our theater outcomes by launch date are:  1)  Spring and Summer months seem to be most popular for plays and 2)  overall all Louise was successful with her productions with the exception of the month of December.
Regarding the outcomes based on goals, we can glean from the following chart that the most successful plays are the ones that cost the least to produce.
 
In conclusion we can see Louise’s efforts in the theater space were not in vain.
